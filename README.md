# Flood-Detection-System-using-Arduino
This project implements an Arduino-based flood detection system that monitors water levels using sensors and triggers alerts when a flood risk is detected. It helps in early flood warnings, allowing timely action to prevent damage.

🔹 Features

Continuous Water Level Monitoring – Uses sensors to track water levels in real-time.

Automatic Alerts – Triggers buzzer and LED alerts when water levels are too high.

LCD Display (Optional) – Displays water level readings and flood risk status.

Wireless Communication (Optional) – Sends SMS alerts via GSM or logs data to an IoT platform.

Battery Backup Support – Ensures functionality during power outages.

🔹 Components Required

Arduino Uno/Nano (Microcontroller)

Water Level Sensor (Ultrasonic sensor, Float sensor, or Conductivity-based sensor)

Buzzer & LED Indicators (For alarm system)

LCD Display (16x2) [Optional] (For status display)

GSM Module [Optional] (For SMS alerts)

WiFi Module (ESP8266/NodeMCU) [Optional] (For IoT integration)

Power Supply Unit & Battery Backup

🔹 How It Works

The water level sensor continuously monitors the height of water.

The Arduino processes the sensor data and compares it with predefined thresholds.

If the water level is safe, the system remains idle.

If the water level is high, an LED warning & buzzer alarm are triggered.

If the water level is critical, an SMS alert or IoT notification is sent (if enabled).

🔹 Installation & Setup

1️⃣ Hardware Connections:

Connect the water level sensor to the Arduino input pins.

Attach the buzzer and LEDs to output pins.

Connect LCD display (optional) for monitoring.

If using GSM/WiFi module, connect it to Arduino for remote alerts.

2️⃣ Software Setup:

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flood-detection-arduino.git

Upload the Code:

Open the code in Arduino IDE.

Select the correct board (Arduino Uno/Nano) and COM port.

Compile and upload the sketch to the Arduino.

Power Up & Test:

Provide power to the circuit.

Observe sensor readings and system response when water level changes.

🔹 Code Explanation

Reads water level sensor data.

Compares it with threshold values.

Activates buzzer & LED warnings if needed.

Sends alerts via GSM or WiFi (if enabled).

🔹 Applications

✅ Flood Early Warning Systems – Prevents property damage & casualties.
✅ Smart Cities & Homes – Automates flood monitoring.
✅ Agriculture & Dams – Monitors water levels for safety.

🔹 Future Improvements
